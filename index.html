	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventOneDescription"><div id="backBTN">Back</div><h3>Pre-USSR Russia</h3><br>Russia was declared an Empire in 1721 by Peter the Great. Reigning until 1725, Peter the Great brought Western European Culture to Russia. Already at this time, Russia was considered a world power. In the years following, Russia had several rulers and was involved in exploration. Russia even discovered Antarctica. In 1881, Russia began to see revolutionary action when Alexander II was killed by the revolutionaries. Alexander III was less liberal but was more peaceful than his father. Events were out of his son, Nicolas II's control however, and between Bloody Sunday and the Russo-Japanese war, he had to deal with a lot, including a revolution in 1905. Despite defeating those who revolted, the Czar was forced to concede multiple freedoms to the public, giving them but a taste of freedom. Despite creating the Duma, Nicolas II stifled the power of it's decisions. Finally, in 1917, after a poor effort in WWI, the Czar was forced to abdicate the throne and was later killed, resulting in the end of the Russian Empire. Nicolas II was executed shortly after. Russia's Czar acted as an absolute monarchy government, similar to that of a socialist government but with less liberal values.<br><figure><img src="images/czar_nicholas_ii-464427021-58e7d7bf3df78c516270b975.jpg" alt="Czar Nicolas II" height="50%" width="33%"><figcaption>Czar Nicolas II</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventTwoDescription"><div id="backBTN2">Back</div><h3>The Russian Revolution</h3><br>Despite Czar Nicolas II's efforts, he was unable to prevent the Revolution that changed Russia forever. Even though Russia obliterated Austria-Hungary's army, the war costs were high and the casualties from WWI were higher. There was civil unrest and it had to end somehow. On March 8th, 1917, about 90, 000 protesters filled the streets of the capital, St. Petersburg. Two days later, all of the cities workers joined the mobs. The next day, the cities military garrison was called to restore peace, in some cases opening fire. On March 12th, after many soldiers too had joined the mob, the protests won and the imperial government was dissolved. March 15th marked the day when the Czar abdicated the throne to his brother, who rejected the crown and ended Czarism. Although this all happened in March, it is called the February Revolution. This was the first step of the revolution. The next step was civil war. Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government in the October Revolution, which resulted in a battle between the Anti-communist White movement and the socialist Bolshevik Red Army. After millions of casualties, the Bolsheviks won and the worlds first socialist country was formed.<br><figure><img src="images/d6genle-52e61a00-69b8-47e5-9a31-12e6525a4968.jpg" alt="Red Army Flag" height="37.5%" width="24%"><figcaption>Red Army Flag</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventThreeDescription"><div id="backBTN3">Back</div><h3>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</h3><br>With the victory by the Bolsheviks and leader Vladimir Lenin, The new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or the USSR had many issues and challenges to face. Lenin started with the creation of the Cheka, the first secret police. However, there was still people who were unhappy, and to keep them happy he introduced the New Economic Policy to satisfy them and boost the economy. As a socialist person, this was not what he wanted to but was essentially forced to adopt some of the liberal policies of the west. Aware of his poor health late in his life, he expressed his view on how the Soviet Union should be ruled upon his death and his disappointment in the popular Joseph Stalin. Lenin died from poor health on January 21st, 1924.<br><figure><img src="images/Vladimir-Ilich-Lenin-1918.jpg" alt="Vladimir Lenin" height="20%" width="20%"><figcaption>Vladimir Lenin</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventFourDescription"><div id="backBTN4">Back</div><h3>Joseph Stalin</h3><br>Joseph Stalin gained power in the early days of the Soviet Union. Though he was never the true head of state, Stalin was ultimately the dictator style ruler of the USSR from 1924 until his death in 1953. During his rule, Stalin introduced the 5 year plans. In 1928, he called for rapid industrialization and focused on heavy industry. However, it had unrealistic goals. Stalin also centralized all industries and services, departing from any form of liberalism and moving towards a communist state. He also focused on agriculture, centralizing it and trying to force produce to feed the nation with surplus directed to pay for the industrialization. Although the Five Year Plan indicated that 20% of all farms should be centralized, it only took a short while for 97% to be centralized. Because of this rapid centralization, Stalin essentially created a famine in Ukrain that killed millions of people. Four years later, Stalin killed nearly a million more kulaks and imprisoned over a million. Stalin led The Soviet Union through World War II and died in declining health in 1953. Stalin's government was a prime example of anti-liberal values.<br><figure><img src="images/b9255ab2-14dd-4881-8f71-922e25485b29.jpg" alt="Joseph Stalin" height="18%" width="18%"><figcaption>Joseph Stalin</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventFiveDescription"><div id="backBTN5">Back</div><h3>The USSR's role in World War 2</h3><br>With Nazi Germany gaining power, and a treaty between Germany and Japan, Stalin's Soviet Union had to do something. When an anti-Nazi treaty failed with Britian and France, and Japan an obvious enemy of the USSR, Stalin and Hitler's Germany made the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggressive treaty for peace. Germany and the USSR subsequently secretly divided Europe in half, with each "owning" half. This led to the USSR initially being part of the central powers during World War II. However, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union's "area", Stalin was very disappointed. However, now on the Allied side of the war, the Soviets were initially forced to backtrack through what was the largest and most powerful invasion in history. The USSR was weakened by Stalin's massacre of the kulak's and Ukrainians. Therefore, it took a while to respond to Germany's attack. They were able to defeat the German's however, including in battles in both Leningrad and Stalingrad, and finally pushing the Germans back and ultimately winning the war in Berlin in 1945. However, the fact that the USSR was so destroyed by Stalin's ways is concerning. It shows that communism to that extent can fail horribly.<br><figure><img src="images/Second_World_War_Europe_05_1941_de.svg" alt="Soviet and Nazi plans for Europe" height="25%" width="25%"><figcaption>Soviet and Nazi plans to divide up Europe</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventSixDescription"><div id="backBTN6">Back</div><h3>The Cold War</h3><br>All was good. The allies had defeated the central powers of Germany and Japan and other because of the extraordinary power of the Americans and the Soviets. But as soon as Germany was defeated, the alliance between these two superpower's began to crumble. Despite never engaging in battle, the two countries struggled to be first through threats, spying, building and gathering power from others. The Soviets favor towards an anti-liberal government shone when they set of pro-communist "buffers" between them and Western Europe in other countries. However, the States showed resistance and set out to prevent the spread of these ideas to other countries such as France, Italy and Greece. When the Allied administered city of Berlin was sieged by the USSR, America provided supplies via airlift for over 200 days. And when the U.S. joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the USSR joined in an agreement with other communist countries. At this time, one of the most influential leaders of the Soviet Union was Nikita Khrushchev. Despite liberalizing Soviet domestic affairs, Khrushchev's visit to the U.S. and the rest of the Soviet actions during the Cold War show that they were still a communist country. Khrushchev's visit to America saw him tour the U.S. and eventually saw the presidents family farm, but negotiations on nuclear disarmament were unabsolved.<br><figure><img src="images/MV5BOTRjODFlZjUtMjRmYS00YmExLWIyOTAtOGNiNjhiMWQxYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_UY317_CR48,0,214,317_AL_.jpg" alt="Nikita Khrushchev" height="10%" width="10%"><figcaption>Nikita Khrushchev</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventSevenDescription"><div id="backBTN7">Back</div><h3>The Space Race</h3><br>While the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a struggle for supremacy, a liberal vs. communist battle, another war was being fought between the two countries. Space was an opportunity to prove either countries technology, military and economy. However, when one thinks of the space race between these two countries, they think of the race to the moon. But it was more than that, missiles in space was a very deadly idea. And in late 1957, a Soviet intercontinental missile launched the first man-made object into orbit, a satelite called Sputnik. Not only did this come as a shock to Americans who viewed space exploration highly, the Soviet's demonstrated their military power through the advanced technology of the missile - the R-7. This brought on espionage into the Soviet military by the States. In response, America launched the Explorer 1 satelite and President Eisenhower created 3 new programs - NASA, designed for space research and exploration; a program led by the Air Force designed to use space for military potential and the third program, ironically code-named Carona, designed to spy on communist countries including the Soviet Union. However, the Soviets maintained their lead when they launched a space probe to the moon and had a man orbit the earth. Very soon later, in fact, not even a month later, the U.S. had a man in space. Despite the U.S. eventually placing man on the moon first, the space race and the battle between the Soviet's and the Americans reinforces what was shown in the Cold War, that the Soviet's had rejected liberal views.<br><figure><img src="images/sputnik_banner.jpg" alt="Sputnik Satelite" height="25%" width="25%"><figcaption>Soviet Sputnik Satelite</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventEightDescription"><div id="backBTN8">Back</div><h3>The End of the Soviet Union</h3><br>The Soviet Union was thriving. Their technology was one of the most advanced in the world. Their economy was thriving. Their military was massive. In short, they were one of the world's most powerful countries, perhaps even the most powerful. But 1979 marked the beginning of the end. Communinst movement in Afganistan were gaining popularity and the Soviet Army moved in to support. However, the action proved unpopular both outside and inside the country. No support was shown by the citezens, nor was the event successful. Nothing seemed to really happen. Financially draining, 10 years later, the Soviet Army was withdrawn, with the only meaningful thing being a distinct financial deficit due to the expense of the military. What made matters worse though, was that in this time of hardship, Mikhail Gorbachev became a leader of the country. Gorbachev sought to democratize the Soviet Union and liberal ideas into the country. However, changing political systems and economies can be resource draining, and the Soviet response helped the cause no less. Strong nationalist and seperatist movements resulted from the change and things began to heat up. Financially drained and in turmoil, the Soviet nation boiled over in 1991. Despite an attempt to preserve the Soviet Union with the proposal of slight reformations, a coup d'etat of anti-Gorbachev politicians tried to oust Gorbachev from his seat of power. Despite falling apart only a few days later, they created such an upheaval in the country that on August 25th, 1991, Gorbachev officially resigned as the Soviet president. From there, multiple republics of the USSR declared independance, and eventually Russia emerged.<br><figure><img src="images/gorvachev.jpg" alt="Mikhail Gorvachev" height="25%" width="12%"><figcaption>Mikhail Gorvachev</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventNineDescription"><div id="backBTN9">Back</div><h3>Russia</h3><br>With the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, multiple meetings and many controversies resulted. On December 8th, three of the Soviet Republics agreed to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and declared that the USSR was gone. However, the legitamacy of the CIS was questioned as only 3 of 12 republics agreed to it. But on December 21, 11 of the 12 Republics had agreed to the CIS and declared the USSR dissolved with the Russian Federation as it's successor state. Elected earlier in June as the president of the Russian Republic (part of the USSR), Boris Yeltsin became the first president of Russia to be elected. This was a step towards a more liberal society in Russia. The collapse of the USSR resulted in deep financial trouble for Russia. In the early days of Russia, many step were taken very quickly towards privatization and free trade. Yeltsin had to deal with multiple battles between rebels. Things only got worse financially, and Russia had a financial crisis is 1998. On December 31 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly stepped down, handing the presidency over to prime minister, Vladimir Putin. By the time Yeltsin resigned, Russia was a more liberal country than the Soviet Union ever had been.<br><figure><img src="images/Boris-Yeltsin-1994.jpg" alt="Boris Yeltsin" height="33%" width="33%"><figcaption>Boris Yeltsin</figcaption></figure></div>
	<div class="descriptionBox hide" id="eventTenDescription"><div id="backBTN10">Back</div><h3>The Leardership of Vladimir Putin</h3><br>On December 31, 1999, Vladimir Putin was appoint president of Russia in Yeltsin's place despite recently being appointed prime minister. Putin helped slowly rebuild the Russian economy untill 2008, when he was no longer eligible to run for his third consecutive term. However, he was appointed prime minister and voted back to presidency in 2012. This sparked huge debate and asked questions of how democratic Russia really is. Riots took to the streets following Putin's reelection. Now, in 2020, Putin has been given permission to run for consecutive terms after his current term ends. This shows that Russia is not truly democratic and that something is being manipulated to suit Putin's needs.<br><figure><img src="images/1200px-Vladimir_Putin_(2020-02-20).jpg" alt="Vladimir Putin" height="20%" width="15%"><figcaption>Vladimir Putin</figcaption></figure></div>
